Subject: Consolidated Library of Things Database for CWMARS - Feedback Welcome

Greetings. My name is David. I'm a Monson resident. I just learned about the 
Library of Things and I wanted a quick way of understanding what's available 
throughout the system.

I used Claude AI to consolidate the CWMARS library of things information/catalogue:

App: https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/0038ec8b-961d-416f-a134-dab32973ff8f
Spreadsheets: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OD59Et8DVJF-sgBYA-PG78I0t43dmzBs/edit

Is this useful? Do you see any inaccuracies? Can I share it around for the public good?

Thanks and best wishes,
David

Subject: Consolidated Library of Things Database for Minuteman Network - Feedback Welcome

Greetings,

My name is David. I'm a Massachusetts resident who recently became fascinated 
by Library of Things programs. I wanted a quick way to understand what's 
available across library networks, so I used Claude AI to consolidate the 
information.

After creating a similar tool for CWMARS, I've now built one for the Minuteman 
Library Network:

App: [PLACEHOLDER - upload to Claude artifacts and insert link]
Spreadsheet: [PLACEHOLDER - upload to Google Sheets and insert link]

I was particularly impressed by Morse Institute Library's collection - it 
appears to be the most extensive tool lending program in Massachusetts, with 
actual power tools like a drill driver kit and pressure washer alongside 
comprehensive home inspection equipment (168+ verified items!).

The database currently includes 230 verified items across 12 libraries, with 
a focus on libraries that have well-documented online collections. I know the 
full MLN Library of Things is much larger (12,000+ items across 40+ libraries), 
so this is just a starting point.

A few questions:
- Is this useful for patrons or staff?
- Do you see any inaccuracies I should correct?
- Would you be open to me sharing it more widely for the public good?
- Is there interest in expanding it to include more MLN libraries?

Thanks and best wishes,

David

## Key Talking Points

### Why This Matters

1. **Discovery Problem**: Library of Things programs are amazing, but discovery is fragmented. Each library has its own webpage, making it hard for patrons to find what's available.

2. **Equity**: These programs provide free access to tools and equipment that many people can't afford to buy, especially for one-time use.

3. **Sustainability**: Sharing resources reduces consumption and waste.

### Notable Findings

1. **Morse Institute Library** (Natick) has the most extensive tool collection in Massachusetts:
   - 168+ verified items
   - Actual power tools (20V drill, pressure washer)
   - Complete home inspection equipment
   - Far surpasses any CWMARS library

2. **Minuteman Network** is ahead of CWMARS in Library of Things adoption:
   - 12,000+ items across 40+ libraries
   - Better online documentation
   - More diverse collections

3. **CWMARS** has fewer documented programs but larger geographic coverage.
